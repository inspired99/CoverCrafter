It can be handy for people without design experience or for those who wish to get a cool cover as soon as possible.

The resulting cover consists of:
- Speaker

- Nice and High-Resolution Background

Please, take a look at our [presentation](CoverCrafter.pdf) for more details and examples.

    It is used for text and cover background generation.

## Web service start

For running web service, run the following command from the project directory:
```
python3 manage.py runserver [port]
```

A port can be, for example, 8080. The web server can be accessed on:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8080/generate
```

NOTE: the used models are heavy, so two video cards 32 GB are needed.

## Generation Example

Here you can see an automatic generation of video preview by user with text prompt about cooking video. The person is taken from video, background was generated automatically and clickbait was also generated based on user preferences and video topic
